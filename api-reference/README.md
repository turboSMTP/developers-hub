# API Reference

The TurboSMTP API is defined using the **OpenAPI 3.1 specification**, which serves as the single source of truth for all SDKs, documentation, and interactive references.

This page is the narrative overview of the API surface. For the **interactive** reference, use the live Swagger UI below.

---

## Interactive Reference

**Live Swagger UI:** [https://turbosmtp.github.io/developers-hub/](https://turbosmtp.github.io/developers-hub/)

A live "Try It" playground for every endpoint, with no local setup required. It is published from the self-contained Swagger UI bundle in [`api-docs/`](../api-docs/) and redeployed automatically on every change via the [deploy-swagger-ui workflow](../.github/workflows/deploy-swagger-ui.yml).

---

## Specification Source

The spec is authored as a **multi-file** OpenAPI 3.1 document:

```
api-docs/turbo-smtp.yaml   # entrypoint
api-docs/Domains/*.yaml    # per-domain path items and schemas
```

It is synced from the canonical source in the sibling repository `../turbo-smtp-openapi/turbo-api-2/` (see the "API Documentation Sync" section of the repo `CLAUDE.md`). Validity is checked on every change via the [validate-openapi workflow](../.github/workflows/validate-openapi.yml).

## Conformance Policy

All TurboSMTP backend behavior must conform to this specification. If you discover a discrepancy between the spec and a live endpoint response (e.g., a type mismatch such as a stringified boolean instead of a JSON boolean), please open a [Bug Report](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Conformance is validated automatically on every commit via the [validate-openapi workflow](../.github/workflows/validate-openapi.yml).
